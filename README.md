## neuralNetwork-Xor_implementation
This project has two parts, the first notebook is a demonstration of a manually build of a Prespectron (a Neural Network which consists of BTU activations) with a single hidden layers.

The seconde notebook contains the same network demonstration with trainning.

## Workflow
the goal is to demonstrate how a simple neural network can implement a Xor Gate,

reminder - a Xor Gate is a binary function that recives two binary inputs, if they are equal then output is equal to '0' otherwise '1'.

In the first part we simplly build a network and tunned the weight values to show how it can implement the Xor function.

In the secode part we demonstrated how the network can actually learn the right vaules of the weights to produce the right output by the use of gradient decent.
